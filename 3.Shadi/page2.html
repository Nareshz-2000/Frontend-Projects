        <h4> Body Language:</h4>
           <p>Pay attention to her body language when she's around you. Signs such as leaning in when talking to you, making frequent eye contact, playing with her hair, or facing her body towards you indicate interest and attraction.
        </p>
        <h4>Initiating Contact:</h4>
            <p>Notice if she initiates contact with you, such as texting or calling first, or finding reasons to be near you or touch you lightly (e.g., brushing your arm or giving hugs). This demonstrates that she enjoys your company and wants to connect with you.
            </p>  
        <h4>Invested Conversations:</h4>
            <p>Look for signs that she's engaged and interested in your conversations. If she asks you questions, actively listens to what you have to say, and remembers details about your life or interests, it shows that she values getting to know you better.
            </p>
        <h4>Making Plans:</h4>
            <p>If she suggests or agrees to spend time with you outside of regular social settings, it's a good sign that she enjoys your company and wants to deepen your connection. This could involve going out for coffee, attending events together, or planning future activities.
            </p>
        <h4>Compliments and Affection:</h4>
            <p>Pay attention to any compliments or affectionate gestures she directs your way. Whether it's complimenting your appearance, praising your achievements, or expressing admiration for your qualities, these signs indicate that she appreciates and admires you.
            </p>
        <h4>Mirroring Your Actions:</h4>
           <p>Notice if she mirrors your actions or adopts similar behaviors. Subconsciously mimicking your gestures, expressions, or mannerisms can indicate a desire to establish rapport and connection with you.
            
            While these signs can suggest that a girl likes you, i's essential to consider the context and her personality. Every person expresses interest differently, so trust your instincts and observe her behavior over time to determine if she's genuinely interested in you.
